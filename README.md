# Unicorn Tracker - Frontend
This is the frontend for the [Unicorn Tracker API](https://github.com/emilyaviva/unicorn-tracker-api).

## Instructions
Run with `yarn start` (to run in hot-reloading development mode) while running the API server on port 3001 in another terminal.

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Not seeing any unicorns?
- Did you start the API server?
- Did you add any unicorns from the Rails console?
